# Healthcare Claim Analysis
Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing healthcare claims data to uncover trends in insurance payouts, claim statuses, and follow-up rates.

Dataset sourced from **Alex The Analystâ€™s GitHub repository** on healthcare analytics for educational and portfolio use.

**Overview:**

This project analyzes healthcare claims data to uncover trends in insurance payouts, claim status distribution, and follow-up rates. Using Excel and Tableau, it visualizes performance metrics to help identify inefficiencies and cost drivers in a simplified claims dataset.

**Project Summary** :

**Data Cleaning & Preparation** : 

- Selected a sample of 60 rows from a larger claims dataset.

- Removed missing values and standardized date formats.

- Ensured columns like Paid Amount, Claim Status, and Follow-up Required were clean and analysis-ready.

**Key KPIs** :

1. Total Paid Amount

2. Average Paid Amount

3. Claim Approval Rate

4. Follow-up required

**Dashboards** :

1. Bar Charts
 
   Total Paid Amount by Insurance Type
   
   Follow-Up Required (Yes/No)

2. Pie Chart

   Claim Status Distribution

3. Interactive Table

   Claims by ID, Date, Status, and Insurance Type

**Tools Used** :

Python : Pre-cleaning for sampling and export

Excel: Data cleaning and preparation

Tableau: KPI dashboards and data storytelling

**What I Achieved through this Project** :

- Identified payout trends by insurance type, highlighting which insurers contributed most to reimbursement totals.

- Calculated a claim approval rate, offering insight into efficiency of processing and denial patterns.

- Measured follow-up burden, which can signal operational delays or incomplete documentation.

- Built a professional dashboard that combines high-level KPIs with detailed data exploration tools.

- Made the data usable for administrative decision-making, reporting, or further healthcare analytics.

**Insights from Python Data Exploration** :

1. The insurance provider contributing the highest total paid amount is **Medicaid**, accounting for **3920** in reimbursements.

2. The average claim payout is **$ 184.2**, with a total paid amount of **$ 11051**.

3. Approximately 28.3% of claims were approved, while 50% required a follow-up.

4. Follow-up required claims signal either unresolved diagnoses or admininstrative delays.
